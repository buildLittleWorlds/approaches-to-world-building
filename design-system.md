# The Design System Method of World-Building

The design system method of world-building can be seen in its purest form in visual design systems such as those created by many companies now to maintain branding patterns across their company materials. The basic ideas of a design system are consistency and decomposition. Consistency refers to the goal of developing a logic or aesthetic that structures every part of the whole. Decomposition refers to the method of building complex elements of the system from repeatable component parts.


## Comparison of the List and Design System Methods of World-Building

There are subtle similarities and differences between creating lists from templates and creating a design system.

1. Primary Focus:
   - Lists and Templates focus on cataloging content and information. They aim to cover a wide range of topics or elements within the world.
   - Design Systems focus on creating a coherent structure and defining relationships between elements. They're more about how things work together than what things exist.

2. Organization:
   - Lists and Templates organize information through categorization. Items are grouped into relevant categories or filled into pre-defined templates.
   - Design Systems use a hierarchical and modular approach. They define base components that can be combined to create more complex elements.

3. Flexibility:
   - Lists and Templates are highly flexible. It's easy to add or remove items without significantly impacting the overall structure.
   - Design Systems are less flexible. Changes to base components can have far-reaching effects throughout the system.

4. Consistency:
   - In Lists and Templates, consistency depends largely on the creator's diligence. There's no inherent mechanism ensuring consistency across different lists or templates.
   - Design Systems have consistency as a core principle. They're specifically designed to ensure a coherent look, feel, or functionality across all elements.

5. Scalability:
   - Lists and Templates have limited scalability. As the world grows more complex, lists can become unwieldy and difficult to manage.
   - Design Systems are highly scalable. Their modular nature allows for the creation of complex structures from simple components.

6. Interconnectedness:
   - Lists and Templates typically have low to moderate interconnectedness. While items may be related, these relationships are not usually a core focus.
   - Design Systems have high interconnectedness. The relationships between components are a fundamental aspect of the system.

While both methods are valuable for world-building, the Design System approach is generally more suited for creating complex, interconnected worlds with consistent internal logic. The Lists and Templates method, on the other hand, excels at quickly populating a world with diverse elements and information.
