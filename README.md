# Approaches to World-Building

This site provides resources for anyone curious about the construction of imaginary worlds. There are many reasons to build imaginary worlds, ranging from writing novels, designing games, theorizing research about literature, pursuing philosophical inquiry, developing a corporate branding strategy, and building such worlds for the fun of it. This site does not assume any particular purpose and curates material organized into five approaches to world-building.

1. [The List and Template Method of World-Building](list-and-template.md)
2. [The Thought-Experiment Method of World-Building](thought-experiment.md)
3. [The Design System Method of World-Building](design-system.md)
4. [The Narrative Method of World-Building](narrative.md)
5. [The Rhetorical Forms Method of World-Building](rhetorical-forms.md)

A website exists with an extended example of world-building making use in a haphazard fashion of all the above. It is called Build Little Worlds, and you can find it [here](https://www.buildlittleworlds.com/).
