# The Rhetorical Forms Method of World-Building

Building a world through the use of rhetorical forms requires at least a few separate pieces in order to be a true example of rhetorical-form world-building. The world-builder produces a joke from the world and a piece of legislation and a traffice sign, all of which must communicate elements of the worldâ€™s reality. Each piece has a purpose in communicating something between the speaker/creator of the piece and the receiver of the piece. The accumulation of different rhetorical forms builds the world by imagining situations requiring different kinds of communication and persuasion.
