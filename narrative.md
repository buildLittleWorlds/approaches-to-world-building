# The Narrative Method of World-Building

The narrative world-building method is the traditional and most common method of creating an imaginary world. The world-builder tells a story, and in the telling of the story, the world comes into being. The narrative method requires a beginning, a middle, and an end. It must stand alone as a single story and will be judged by the “standing-aloneness” of the work.
