# The Thought-Experiment Method of World-Building

The thought-experiment world-building method has its origin in philosophy and a certain kind of philosophical story-telling. The thought experiment is the natural answer to the question, “What if?” If one were to ask, “What if the moon were made of cheese?” The answer to this question would involve the world-builder in spelling out all the possible implications of an astronomical body of massive size being made out of cheese. And the creative mind takes it from there.
